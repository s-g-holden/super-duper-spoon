# Deployments

This folder contains terragrunt configurations that specify the different 
deployments of the project.


## Structure

The deployments folder is organized as follows:

```
  .
  ├── dev/                       <configuration for the development environment>
  │   ├── env.hcl                <environment configuration>
  │   └── eu-west-2/             <configurations for eu-west-2 region>
  │       ├──region.hcl          <region configuration>
  │       └── quando/            <configuration directory for quando>
  │           └── terragrunt.hcl <quando deployment configuration>
  └── terragrunt.hcl             <root terragrunt configuration>
```


## Requirements

* tgswitch: Command-line tool for switching between Terragrunt versions.
* tfswitch: Command-line tool for switching between Terraform versions.
* AWS Profile: Configure an AWS profile with the necessary permissions for 
resource management.

Ensure you have tgswitch, tfswitch, and an AWS profile set up to run Terragrunt 
commands for this project.


## Running Terragrunt Commands

The dev directory is where you should run Terragrunt commands for the 
development environment.

To execute a command for all modules within the dev deployment, navigate to the 
dev directory in your terminal & use the following syntax:

```
  terragrunt run-all <command>
```

Replace <command> with any terraform command: init, plan, apply.
This command will execute for all modules defined in the deployment.
[Read more about "run-all"](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/execute-terraform-commands-on-multiple-modules-at-once/)

To generate an execution plan for all modules in the dev deployment & update 
the module source code before running the plan, use the following command:

```
  terragrunt run-all plan --terragrunt-source-update
```

This command updates the source code for all modules & generates an execution 
plan for the dev deployment.

To apply changes to all modules within the dev deployment, 
use the following command:

```
  terragrunt run-all apply
```

This command applies the changes defined in the configuration for the dev 
deployment.
